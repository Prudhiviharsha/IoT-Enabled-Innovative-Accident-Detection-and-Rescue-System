#IoT-Enabled-Innovative-Accident-Detection-and-Rescue-System
To detect vehicle accidents automatically using sensors and immediately send alerts (location and message) to emergency contacts or rescue teams through GSM and GPS modules — ensuring faster response and saving lives.

--> PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The project integrates IoT technology.
When a vehicle accident occurs:
The vibration sensor or accelerometer detects the collision.
The Arduino Uno processes this signal.
The GSM module sends an SMS alert to emergency services and family.
The GPS module provides exact location coordinates (Google Maps link).
LCD and buzzer indicate accident status visually and audibly.
Optionally, Wi-Fi sends data to cloud platforms (e.g., ThingSpeak).

--> SOFTWARE TOOLS:
Arduino IDE – for writing and uploading Embedded C code to Arduino
Embedded C Programming – controls sensors and modules
ThingSpeak API – for online IoT data monitoring
Windows OS – development platform

-->WORKING PRINCIPLE:
Monitoring Phase:
The system continuously reads data from the vibration sensor.
Accident Detection:
When an abnormal vibration or impact is sensed, it assumes a collision.
Alert Generation:
Sends “Accident Detected” SMS via GSM.
Sends GPS coordinates (Google Maps link).
Activates buzzer and displays alert on LCD.
Rescue Operation:
The emergency team or family uses the coordinates to reach the location quickly.

-->FUTURE SCOPE:
Add AI/Machine Learning for smart detection (to reduce false alarms).
Integrate cameras for live video of accident scene.
Use cloud storage for long-term data analysis.
Connect to traffic control systems for intelligent routing of ambulances.
